As of now, I believe that we can capture many ideal behaviors. For instance,
if we were to fully develop this page, add other features such as language,
zoom in-out, text-reader, let the use choose the page's background and more, 
we could be intrigged on how many visitors we have per day, what is the most 
frequent feature used, and what can we do to those features not so usabel. 
This is when analytics make sense and provide a pattern that will help us 
enhance our product, and eventually bring more users. By having credible data, 
we should be able to provide the desired design with the desired capabilities. 
We should consider the type of users we have, find out what they like the most, 
and the simply provide it to them as it will a win for both parties. Using tools 
such as Heap, we could make that possible. It will provide critical knowledge 
on how users interact with our product and therefore, we should be ready to 
make the necessary adjustments.
